      From high school I have experience from IT1 and IT2, where I learned HTML
      and CSS.
    </p>
    <p>In IT2 we used LiveCode, which is closer to python.</p>
    <p>
      I don't know any JavaScript, so I look forward to learning it through this
      course.

    <h3>Assignment 1</h3>

      <li>
        The server in the client server architecture provides a function or
        service to one or many clients.
      </li>
      <li>The client requests a server's content or service function.</li>
      <li>
        An IP address is a unique numeric identifier that identifies each
        computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.
      </li>
      <li>
        A DNS is the phonebook of the Internet. Different browsers interact
        through IP addresses. It is the DNS that translates domain names to IP
        addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Internet is a global network of networks while the Web, also
        referred formally as World Wide Web (www) is collection of information
        which is accessed via the Internet.
      </li>
      <li>
        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and is a standardized system
        for tagging text files to achieve font, colour, graphic, and hyperlink
        effects on web pages.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Assignment 2</h3>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Inline style CSS overrides rules defined in style elements and external
        stylesheets because the attribute 'style=".."' is the most specific one
        and therefore always has precedence. It also makes it easier to change
        unique elements instead of creating a new class for it in the
        stylesheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        One uses ID when we want to apply CSS to one attribute only, meanwhile
        the classes are used on several elements.
      </li>
      <li>
        RGBA is a type of CSS color value that allows us to set a color and also
        its opacity/transparency. The first three values — red, green, blue —
        can either be integers between 0 and 255 or percentages between 0% and
        100%. These values describe the amount of red, green, and blue in the
        desired color.
      </li>
      <li>
        We include CSS files inside the head element and not inside the body
        element because this causes the site to load the CSS first, which will
        then cause the site to load faster.
      </li>
      <li>
        The 'element element' CSS selector, in this case 'article p' matches all
        the p elements inside the article element in the following HTML.
      </li>

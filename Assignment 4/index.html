    <h2>O-Zone</h2>
    <p>O-Zone first formed as a duo of Dan Balan and Petru Jelihovschi in 1998. They released their first album, Dar,
      Unde Ești..., in 1999. However, Jelihovschi had not intended to make music his career, so he split from Balan.
      Undaunted, Balan held open auditions for new band members. At one such audition, he met Arsenie "Arsenium"
      Todiraş, who eventually won over the initially skeptical Balan with his version of Elvis Presley's "Love Me
      Tender". Balan and Arsenium would have proceeded as a duo act until Balan received a call from Radu Sîrbu, who
      wanted a chance to audition for the group. Despite Sîrbu having missed the initial auditions, Bălan agreed, and
      after a successful audition, Sîrbu joined O-Zone, officially making the group a trio.</p>
